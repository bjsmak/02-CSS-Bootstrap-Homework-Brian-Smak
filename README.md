# Portfolio
<a href="https://bjsmak.github.io/Portfolio/">LINK HERE</a>

Using CSS and Bootstrap functionality, the assignment was given to create a portfolio page with the following criteria <p>
*A bio page, including a list of links to social media<p>
*A portfolio page<p>
*A contact page<p>
  
 The portfolio is not only a good start for a developer but it also shows the use of the grid system and google fonts that were incorporated into the page. Media responsiveness is another important concept demonstrated in this activity. By looking at different displays through Chrome DevTools, the css styling was changed to accomodate whether or not the client is on a smaller device.
